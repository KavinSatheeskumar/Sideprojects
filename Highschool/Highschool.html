		<h1 class="name">Electron Levels</h1>
		<p class="description">In atoms, electrons act as both waves and particles. As a result, as they orbit atoms, they can only form stable orbits when the circumference of that orbit is an integer multiple of their wavelength. This is because at all other orbits the electron destructively interferes with itself. This side project simulates that by adding various sine waves together. A variation of this code was used to make the image that is the front page of this website.</p>

		<h1 class="name">A Wierd Map on the Complex Plane</h1>
		<p class="description">The name summarizes this project well. First, every point on the plane was assigned a colour based on the angle it forms with the x-axis and grid lines were overlaid. Two Mappings were then applied to get the final image, one map from the complex plane to a sphere and another from the sphere to a rectangle. The first map is a stereographic projection. This mapping sees a line between every point on the plane and the top of a sphere. The point where the line intersects the sphere is where that original point on the plane is mapped to. After this first mapping, every point is now mapped onto a unique point on the sphere, described by two angles. The final mapping just takes these two angles and plots one on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. These two mappings effectively compress the entire complex plane down to a smaller square. This side project lets a user perform another function onto the complex plane beforehand, this way, they can see the effect of the function on the entire plane.</p>

		<p class="description">Here are some examples. In order, these are the functions f(x) = x, f(x) = 1/x and f(x) = (x - 1)/(x + 1)</p>
